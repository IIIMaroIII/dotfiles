━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PHILOSOPHY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Stay in Normal mode as much as possible
  Insert mode = only for typing NEW text, nothing else
  Use motions + operators instead of manual edits
  Use text objects instead of multiple motions
  Use . to repeat instead of retyping
  Use macros for repetitive multi-step edits
  Avoid arrow keys — use h/j/k/l and motions
  Think in: operator + motion, operator + text-object
  Think in: verb + noun  (d=delete, w=word → dw)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MODES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Normal       navigation & commands (default — live here)
  Insert       typing new text only
  Visual       selecting text
  Command      :commands
  jk           → Normal mode from Insert  [REMAPPED]
  Esc          → Normal mode from any mode

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. NORMAL MODE — MOVEMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BASIC
  h j k l          ← ↓ ↑ →
  w / W            next word / WORD (WORD ignores punctuation)
  b / B            previous word / WORD
  e / E            end of word / WORD
  gg               top of file
  G                bottom of file
  {number}G        go to line number  (e.g. 42G)
  %                jump to matching bracket/paren/brace

LINE NAVIGATION
  Ctrl-a           first non-blank character  [REMAPPED from ^]
  Ctrl-e           end of line                [REMAPPED from $]
  0                absolute start of line (including whitespace)
  ^                native: first non-blank character
  $                native: end of line

CHARACTER JUMPS  (extremely powerful, learn these)
  f{char}          jump forward to char on line (cursor lands on char)
  F{char}          jump backward to char on line
  t{char}          jump forward, stop before char
  T{char}          jump backward, stop before char
  ;                repeat last f/F/t/T forward
  ,                repeat last f/F/t/T backward

COUNTS (combine with any motion)
  5j               move 5 lines down
  3w               jump 3 words forward
  2b               jump 2 words backward

FILE NAVIGATION
  Ctrl-d           half page down (most used — learns your rhythm)
  Ctrl-u           half page up
  Ctrl-f           full page down
  Ctrl-b           full page up
  zz               center cursor on screen
  zt               cursor to top of screen
  zb               cursor to bottom of screen

SEARCH NAVIGATION
  /pattern         search forward
  ?pattern         search backward
  n                next match
  N                previous match
  *                search word under cursor (forward)
  #                search word under cursor (backward)
  leader+nh        clear search highlights  [REMAPPED]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2. OPERATORS (verbs) — combine with motions or text objects
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  d                delete (cut)
  c                change (delete + enter insert mode)
  y                yank (copy)
  >                indent right
  <                indent left
  =                auto-indent
  g~               toggle case
  gu               lowercase
  gU               uppercase

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3. TEXT OBJECTS (nouns) — the most powerful vim concept
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  i = inner (excludes surrounding chars)
  a = around/a (includes surrounding chars)

  iw / aw          inner word / a word (with space)
  is / as          inner sentence / a sentence
  ip / ap          inner paragraph / a paragraph
  i" / a"          inside/around double quotes
  i' / a'          inside/around single quotes
  i` / a`          inside/around backticks
  i( / a(          inside/around parentheses
  i[ / a[          inside/around brackets
  i{ / a{          inside/around curly braces
  i< / a<          inside/around angle brackets
  it / at          inside/around HTML/XML tag

EXAMPLES (operator + text object)
  ciw              change inner word (most used)
  daw              delete a word including trailing space
  ci"              change text inside quotes
  ca(              change everything including the parentheses
  yi{              yank everything inside curly braces
  =ip              auto-indent inner paragraph
  >i{              indent inside curly braces

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4. COMMON SHORTCUTS (doubled operator = acts on whole line)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  dd               delete whole line
  cc               change whole line
  yy               yank whole line
  D                delete from cursor to end of line
  C                change from cursor to end of line
  d^               delete to start of line (native)
  d Ctrl-a         delete to start of line  [REMAPPED]
  Y                yank whole line (same as yy)
  x                delete character under cursor
  X                delete character before cursor
  r{char}          replace single character under cursor (no insert mode!)
  s                delete char and enter insert mode
  S                delete line and enter insert mode

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5. ENTERING INSERT MODE (choose the right one)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  i                insert before cursor
  a                insert after cursor
  I                insert at start of line
  A                insert at end of line
  o                open new line below and insert
  O                open new line above and insert
  gi               re-enter insert at last insert position

  PRO TIP: prefer A, I, o, O over navigating then pressing i

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6. UNDO / REDO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  u                undo
  Ctrl-r           redo
  U                undo all changes on current line
  .                repeat last change (extremely powerful)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7. COPY / PASTE (registers)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  yy / Y           yank line
  yw               yank word

  "{reg}p          paste from named register (e.g. "ap)
  "+y              yank to system clipboard
  "+p              paste from system clipboard

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Ctrl-a           select to start of line  [REMAPPED]
  Ctrl-e           select to end of line  [REMAPPED]
  o                move to other end of selection
