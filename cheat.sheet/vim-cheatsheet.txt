" ==================================================


" ------------------------
" BASIC PHILOSOPHY
" ------------------------
Vim is modal.
Stay in Normal mode as much as possible.
Use motions + operators instead of manual edits.
Use repetition (.) and macros instead of retyping.


" ------------------------
" MODES
" ------------------------
Normal Mode   → navigation & commands
Insert Mode   → typing text
Visual Mode   → selecting text
Command Mode  → :commands


" ==================================================
" NORMAL MODE – MOVEMENT
" ==================================================

h j k l        ← ↓ ↑ →
w / W          next word / WORD
b / B          previous word / WORD
e / E          end of word / WORD
0              beginning of line
^              first non-blank character
$              end of line
gg             top of file
G              bottom of file
%              matching bracket

f{char}        jump forward to char
F{char}        jump backward to char
t{char}        jump before char
T{char}        jump before char (backward)
;              repeat last f/t motion
,              repeat in opposite direction

5j             move 5 lines down
3k             move 3 lines up


" ==================================================
" NORMAL MODE – EDITING
" ==================================================

x              delete character
dd             delete line
D              delete to end of line

" ==================================================
" OPERATORS + MOTIONS (CORE POWER)
" ==================================================

d + motion     delete
c + motion     change

c0             change to beginning of line
df,            delete until comma
ct)            change until )


" ==================================================
" TEXT OBJECTS (HIGH EFFICIENCY)
" ==================================================

Word:
ciw            change inner word

Quotes:
ci"            change inside double quotes
di"            delete inside double quotes
ci'            change inside single quotes

Parentheses / Brackets:
ci(            change inside ()
di(            delete inside ()
ci{            change inside {}
di{            delete inside {}
ci[            change inside []
di[            delete inside []

Paragraph:
vip            select inner paragraph
vap            select around paragraph


" ==================================================
" INSERT MODE
" ==================================================

i              insert before cursor
I              insert at line start
a              append after cursor
A              append at line end
o              new line below
O              new line above

Esc            leave insert mode
jk / jj / kj   fast escape (mapped)
Ctrl-[         alternative escape

Insert shortcuts:
Ctrl-w         delete previous word
Ctrl-u         delete to start of line
Ctrl-h         delete character
Ctrl-n / Ctrl-p completion


" ==================================================
" VISUAL MODE
" ==================================================

v              character-wise
V              line-wise
Ctrl-v         block mode

y              yank selection
d              delete selection
c              change selection
> / <          indent / unindent
=              auto-indent
o              switch selection edge


Block Editing:
Ctrl-v + j
I              insert at start of block
A              append at end of block


" ==================================================
" SEARCHING
" ==================================================

/pattern       search forward
?pattern       search backward
n              next match
N              previous match
:nohlsearch    clear highlights

ignorecase + smartcase:
lowercase search → case-insensitive
uppercase in search → case-sensitive


" ==================================================
" SCROLLING
" ==================================================

Ctrl-d         half page down
Ctrl-u         half page up
Ctrl-f         full page down
Ctrl-b         full page up
zz             center cursor
zt             cursor to top
zb             cursor to bottom


" ==================================================
" WINDOWS & TABS
" ==================================================

:split         horizontal split
:vsplit        vertical split

Ctrl-w h/j/k/l move between splits
Ctrl-w =       equalize splits
Ctrl-w q       close split

:tabnew        new tab
gt             next tab
gT             previous tab
:tabclose      close tab


" ==================================================
" LEADER KEY (Space)
" ==================================================

Leader = Space

Space w        save
Space q        quit
Space x        save & quit
Space t        new tab
Space h        clear search highlight

Window navigation:
Space h/j/k/l


" ==================================================
" MACROS (AUTOMATION POWER)
" ==================================================

qa             start recording macro in register a
q              stop recording
@a             run macro
@@             repeat last macro
10@a           run macro 10 times

Workflow:
1. qa
2. perform edits
3. q
4. @a or 10@a

Tips:
- Stay in Normal mode
- Combine with text objects
- Use . to repeat inside macro
- Macros are ideal for repetitive refactoring


" ==================================================
" ERGONOMIC RULES (10-FINGER FLOW)
" ==================================================

• Remap CapsLock → Esc (OS level)
• Use jk/jj for escape
• Avoid arrow keys
• Use f/t/; , instead of small cursor moves
• Use text objects instead of multiple motions
• Use . instead of repeating commands manually
• Use macros instead of repetitive edits
• Stay in Normal mode whenever possible


" ==================================================
" ADVANCED HABITS
" ==================================================

Use:
.              repeat last change
*              search word under cursor
#              search backward word under cursor
:%s/old/new/g  replace in file
:g/pattern/d   delete matching lines

Think in:
operator + motion
operator + text-object
repeat + macro
